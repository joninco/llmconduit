//! G4 — Image agent (vision offload).
//!
//! Ports claude-relay's in-proxy vision offload to llmconduit's canonical
//! Responses pipeline. The model the client talks to is (typically) text-only;
//! images in the latest user turn are stripped to `[Image #N]` placeholders,
//! cached, and an `analyzeImage` server tool is injected. When the model calls
//! `analyzeImage`, the engine resolves the cached image(s), forwards them to a
//! vision-capable backend via [`VisionClient`], and injects the description back
//! into the chat history as a tool result — exactly the way Brave `web_search`
//! is run server-side.
//!
//! Mirrors `src/search.rs`'s `SearchClient` seam: a trait object so tests inject
//! a `MockVisionClient`. The cache is intentionally SEPARATE from `ReplayStore`
//! (replay is SHA256 over `(model, instructions, input)` with no TTL); this is a
//! per-session LRU+TTL keyed by `(session_id, image_id)` that is cleared and
//! repopulated every time [`ImageCache::strip_and_cache_images`] runs, so
//! multi-turn placeholder numbering resets like claude-relay's stateless replay.
//!
//! Module layout (grouped by concern):
//! - [`cache`] — the per-session LRU+TTL [`ImageCache`] storage/eviction.
//! - [`strip`] — request mutation: strip images to placeholders, inject the
//!   `analyzeImage` tool + system prompt, and the activation predicate.
//! - [`client`] — the [`VisionClient`] seam, [`VisionRequest`]/[`VisionOutcome`],
//!   and the production [`ReqwestVisionClient`].
//!
//! Image-URI redaction lives in the sibling [`crate::redaction`] module (it is
//! not vision-specific); the three redactors are re-exported here so existing
//! `crate::vision::redact_*` call sites keep resolving.
