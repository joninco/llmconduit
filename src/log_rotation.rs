//! Age-based cleanup of debug / request-log dump files.
//!
//! The upstream request log (`upstream_request_log_path`) is append-only JSONL
//! with no rotation, so the directory holding dump files can grow unbounded.
//! This module deletes eligible dump files older than a configurable max age.
//!
//! F1f (durable turn capture) reuses the SAME age window for two surfaces under a
//! `turn_capture_dir`: [`cleanup_dump_files`] prunes the published
//! `<api_call_id>.json` artifacts (top-level `*.json`), and
//! [`cleanup_orphan_work_dirs`] sweeps orphaned per-turn `.work/<id>/` section dirs
//! left behind when a process crashes before `TurnCaptureState::finalize_and_assemble`
//! could delete them. Both run in the same [`spawn_cleanup`] pass, but with DISTINCT
//! scopes — the artifact/dump prune spans every `Config::debug_log_dirs()` entry, while
//! the destructive `.work` sweep is scoped to `turn_capture_dir` ALONE (turn capture is
//! the sole creator of `.work/<id>/` subdirs, and only under `turn_capture_dir`, so the
//! sweep must never run over a request-log dir — F1f review r1). Neither reclaims an
//! in-flight turn (its section files carry fresh mtimes, so it is younger than the
//! window — and the production caller only runs cleanup at startup, before any turn is
//! registered).
//!
//! The core [`cleanup_dump_files`] / [`cleanup_orphan_work_dirs`] functions are
//! synchronous and take an injected `now`, so tests can age entries out by passing a
//! cutoff rather than backdating mtimes. Callers on the tokio runtime must invoke them
//! via `spawn_blocking` (see [`spawn_cleanup`]) because they perform blocking
//! filesystem IO.
