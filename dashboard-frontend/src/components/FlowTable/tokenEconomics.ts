/**
 * Token-economics derivations (gap 08) — the cached / reasoning token split, the cache-hit
 * rate, and the "$ saved by prefix caching" figure. Pure + DOM-free so the popover, the
 * inspector line, and the aggregate panel share ONE honest computation (and it is unit-testable).
 *
 * The operator question (spec 08): "Is prefix caching saving money, and what are reasoning
 * models really costing?" This module makes that legible WITHOUT lying:
 *
 * Data-quality contract (baked into every value here — Codex checks this):
 *  - Token SPLIT (cached / reasoning) is `measured`: it is the upstream-reported count. An
 *    UNREPORTED class (`usage.cached`/`reasoning` is `null`/absent — the gap-07 `Option`) is
 *    `unavailable` ⇒ renders `—`, NEVER `0`. A provider-reported `0` is a MEASURED zero (a real
 *    cache miss) ⇒ renders `0`, distinct from `—`.
 *  - Cache-hit RATE is `derived` (`cached / prompt`). It is `unavailable` when `cached` is
 *    unreported (you cannot claim a hit rate you did not measure) — NOT counted as a 0% miss.
 *    A reported `cached === 0` is a genuine `0%` (a real miss), distinct from unavailable.
 *  - "$ SAVED" is `derived` and shown ONLY when the served model has a CONFIGURED cached price
 *    (gap-07 `cached_price_configured` PRESENCE flag) AND the cached count is reported. A mere
 *    numeric `cached_per_1k` of `0.0` (the config default for an OMITTED rate) does NOT qualify —
 *    that would fabricate a saving. Absent presence ⇒ the split shows with NO dollar figure.
 *
 * Cost itself is owned by the backend (`flowModel.flowCost` / the `cost_confidence` tag); this
 * module never re-derives the flow cost. The only `derived` dollar formula here is the documented
 * cache SAVING, which the spec explicitly permits ("`$ saved` `derived`, only when configured").
