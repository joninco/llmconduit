/**
 * attemptTrace (gap 11) — turn the gap-03 `attempts[]` failover trace into a render-ready
 * STEPPER for the FlowDetail inspector header. Pure + DOM-free (sibling of `latencyBreakdown.ts`/
 * `contextUtilization.ts`/`tokenEconomics.ts`) so the stepper can never disagree with the numbers
 * it derives, and so the don't-lie-with-zeros rules are unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * The operator question (spec 11): "Which provider failed, why, how long did we wait, and what
 * served?" — answered as the ORDERED chain of dispatch attempts:
 *
 *   A failed: 503 · 0.8s  →  B served · 1.2s
 *
 * SOURCE (spec 11 — the oracle): the gap-03 `attempts[]` (each `Attempt` is body-free scalar
 * provenance + bounded taxonomic codes). The failover loop records one node per provider it tried
 * (the failed ones + the one that served); a non-failover flow records exactly ONE node. We render
 * exactly what the backend measured — never a synthesized/fake failover.
 *
 * DATA-QUALITY INVARIANTS (the heart of an honest trace — each is asserted in the sibling tests):
 *  - The whole trace + each node's WHICH/WHY (provider, model, status, `error_class`,
 *    `failover_reason`) is `measured` — it comes straight from `attempts[]`.
 *  - A node's DURATION is `measured` from `end_ms − start_ms` when both are present + ordered; a
 *    disordered pair (end < start) clamps to 0 + is FLAGGED (`disordered`), NEVER rendered negative.
 *  - A per-attempt `first_upstream_byte_ms` that is absent/null renders `—` (UNAVAILABLE), NEVER a
 *    fabricated `0ms` (spec 11 acceptance: "a per-attempt unmeasured time renders `—`, not `0`").
 *    A genuine measured `0` first-byte (start == byte) is DISTINCT — it reads `0ms`.
 *  - A SINGLE-attempt flow yields a SINGLE node and `isFailover === false` (no fake failover chain);
 *    `≥ 2` attempts yields the chain (`isFailover === true`).
 *  - The SERVED node (status `served`) is marked `isServed` so the UI can render it visually
 *    distinct; a trace with no served attempt (every provider failed) has none.
 *  - An EMPTY/absent `attempts[]` ⇒ an empty trace (`nodes: []`, `hasTrace === false`): the stepper
 *    renders nothing rather than inventing a node.
