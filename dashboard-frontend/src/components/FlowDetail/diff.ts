 *
 * The inspector shows three layers of the SAME logical request as it is transformed:
 *   A = raw inbound body      → B = normalized Responses    → C = upstream chat body
 * To tint what the gateway changed, we compare the layer to the PREVIOUS one and classify
 * every JSON path as added / removed / changed / unchanged. The classification is keyed by a
 * canonical path string (`$.a.b[0].c`) so a `JsonPane` rendering the *right-hand* layer can
 * look up the tint for the value it is about to print, and a pane rendering the *left-hand*
 * layer can show what was removed.
 *
 * "Structural" = we walk the parsed JSON tree by path, NOT a textual line diff. Reordered
 * object keys therefore do NOT register as a change (objects are compared key-wise); only a
 * value/shape difference at a path does. Arrays are compared positionally (index = path
 * segment) — a reorder is a change, matching how a reader reasons about `messages[0]`.
